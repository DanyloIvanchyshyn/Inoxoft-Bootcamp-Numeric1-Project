# Youtube Trends Inoxoft-Bootcamp-Project
Pet-project, developed during Inoxoft Data-Focused Programming Bootcamp 2021 <br /> <br />


### Data-resources:

1) https://www.kaggle.com/harshithgupta/youtubes-channels-dataset

2) https://www.kaggle.com/jyotmakadiya/top-trending-videos-youtube-2021 <br /> <br />


### Data overview:

The datasets contain a total of 41 columns from two datasets describing interesting features such as Title, date/time of upload, description of video.

Currently, the first one contains data from 10 Regions/Countries scrapped from Google YouTube API. The second dataset is a daily record of the top trending YouTube videos. <br /> <br />

### Our tasks - we've decided to move on with the next ones:

1) What makes a Youtube video (or/and channel) more popular when compared to others?
2) Do there exists any underlying factors which affect the popularity of a video (or/and channel) on Youtube?
3) Could we, and if so, how adjust the video parameters to make it more popular?

Wish us the best of luck on our journey! <br /> <br />
